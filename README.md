# py_registration-form
This project aims to develop a simple registration form using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit in Python. The registration form will include basic fields such as name, email, password, and a submit button. Tkinter provides an intuitive way to create graphical interfaces, making it suitable for beginners and small-scale projects. The form will validate user inputs, ensuring that required fields are filled and the email follows a standard format. Upon successful submission, the entered information will be stored or processed as desired. This project serves as an introductory exercise to GUI programming in Python and demonstrates how Tkinter can be utilized to create interactive forms for various applications.
